# Silicon Labs Bluetooth Applications #

The Silicon Labs Bluetooth stack allows for a wide variety applications to be built on its foundation. This repo showcases some example applications built using the Silicon Labs Bluetooth stack.

## Examples ##

- BLE Man-in-the-Middle vulnerability Demo with a solution
- BLE NFC Pairing with NT3H2111 and NT3H2211
- BLE SPP over BLE (Serial Port Profile)
- BLE SPP with Windows (Serial Port Profile)
- BLE OTA Firmware Update in User Application example
- BLE Uploading Images to Internal/External Flash Using OTA DFU
- Explorer Kit BLE accelerometer example using I2C bus BMA400 accelerometer
- Explorer Kit BLE barometer example using I2C bus DPS310 pressure sensor
- Explorer Kit BLE bio-sensor example using I2C bus MAXM86161 HR and SpO2 sensor
- Explorer Kit BLE bio-sensor example using I2C bus MAXM86161 HR/SpO2 sensor and OLED display
- IR Generator (InfraRed)
- Log system example using UART(VCOM) or RTT with message levels
